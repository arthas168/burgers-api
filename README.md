# Burgers API üçî

**Burgers API** is a spin-off of https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2, but instead of for beers - for burgers. The API is built with **Rust**, the **Diesel** framework with a postgres database, and of course, the **Rocket** web framework. 

**Burgers API** supports all the basic **CRUD** operations, along with a method that returns a random burger. The API also provides functionality to look up burgers by name, it's important to note that the search is case-insensitive and partial, meaning that if we have *"Pulled pork burger"* and *"Classic pork burger"* in our database, searching with *"PO"* will match both.

The service is hosted on a **DigitalOcean** droplet, running **Ubuntu** 18.04 (LTS) x64, with **NGINX** as a reverse proxy. It also has an **SSL Certificate** is provided by CertBot.

All of these endpoints will be covered below, but there is also a Postman collection that can help you with testing the API out - https://github.com/arthas168/burgers-api/blob/main/Burgers-API.postman_collection.json, simply download it and import it in your local Postman workspace.

## API Reference:

### Root Endpoint:
`http://burger-api.ml`

*The root endpoint itself does not return anything, but it prefixes all other service endpoints.*

### List All Burgers:
**GET** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers` - when successful, returns `200 Ok` along with a list of Burger objects, each containing 3 fields - id (autogenerated), name and description.

### Get a Burger With a Specific ID:
**GET** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers/<id>` - when successful, returns `200 Ok` along with one Burger object, matching the given unique id.
  
### Add a New Burger:
**POST** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers` with a JSON body that takes a name and a description, for instance:
> {
    "name": "Classic Beef Burger",
    "description": "White bread, beef, veggies, spices"
}

Returns `201 Created` when successful, along with the created Burger object.

### Update an Existing Burger:
**PUT** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers/<id>` with a JSON body that takes a name and a description, for instance:
> {
    "name": "Pulled pork burger",
    "description": "White bread, pulled pork, veggies, spices"
}

Returns `200 Ok` when successful, along with the updated Burger object.
  
### Delete a Burger:
**DELETE** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers/<id>` - when when successful returns `204 No Content` and deletes the Burger with the given unique ID.
  
### Get a Random Burger:
**GET** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers/random` - when successful, returns `200 Ok` along with one random Burger object. For reference on how that works: https://crates.io/crates/rand

### Find Bugers by Name:
**GET** `http://burger-api.ml/burgers/name/<name>` - when successful, returns `200 Ok` along with a list of Burger objects, the names of which partially (and case-insensitively) match the name given in the request.
  
*All invalid requests to the API will return the appropriate error.*

## Running Burgers API locally
In order to run this repo locally, you'll need the latest version of **Rust nightly**, as well as an active **Postgres DB** running locally. Use the `.env.example` to set up your environment variables and after that simply run `cargo run` in the project root directory.

## Testing
All of the endpoints are tested using Rocket's testing utilities. When you've configured the service locally you can run `cargo test` and hopefully all 8 tests will pass.
